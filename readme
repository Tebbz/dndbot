Hi!

If you've found this... good job! I just started on this project (27/4/2020).

I will be making a (semi) coherent 'D&D Bot' for Discord.
It will be able to roll dice, keep an initiative list, and search for D&D-related info (somehow).
I'm sure I will add more functionality to it later on.

If you've come to watch the journey, sit back and relax! I'll be working on it often.
If you've come to assist in the coding/give helpful insight into what I could be doing... then I'd love the help!

Note: you can send over an e-mail (find it on the account) if you'd want to get in touch.
