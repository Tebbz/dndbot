Hi!

If you've found this... good job! I just started on this project (27/4/2020).

I will be making a (semi) coherent 'D&D Bot' for Discord.
It will be able to roll dice, keep an initiative list, and search for D&D-related info (somehow).
I'm sure I will add more functionality to it later on.

If you've come to watch the journey, sit back and relax! I'll be working on it often.
If you've come to assist in the coding/give helpful insight into what I could be doing... then I'd love the help!

Note: you can send over an e-mail (find it on the account) if you'd want to get in touch.

UPDATE (29/4/2020):
I have rewritten the original to be a lot better. Here's what I have so far:

.r ==> Our 'roll' command. 

It accepts a parameter (or multiple) that look like this... .r d4 d4+2 2d4 2d4+2
It does have some limitations but it will give an error message and prevent these limitations from being reached.

.dm
.dmset
.dmrem

These are all lumped together as the 'Dungeon Master' commands.
.dm will show the current Dungeon Master if possible.
.dmset will set the User who sent the command as the Dungeon Master.
.dmrem will remove the current Dungeon Master if possible.
Not much is done with this information... I haven't implemented a single thing to function with knowing who the DM is.
Perhaps that could change in the future...

.il
.iladd
.ilrem
.ilshow

These are the 'Initiative List' commands.
.il will show the current Initiative List if possible.

.iladd (initiative) (name...) will add a creature to the Initiative List with the respective name and initiative.
Note: when sent from a 'public' channel the creature will be set to 'Shown' wherein its name will appear in full.
If the command is sent to D&D Bot in a 'direct message' then the creature will be set to 'Hidden'.
A creature that is 'Hidden' will have its name show up like this:
Example: .iladd 19 DNDBOT ==> D***
1st character of the name will appear followed by some asterisks.

.ilrem (name...) will remove a creature from the Initiative List with the same name.
Note: if there are two creatures on the list with the same name it will remove the one with the higher initiative first.

.ilshow is used to change a creature from 'Hidden' to 'Shown'.

I've also added a .s command used to play some sound files located in "res\sound"
This is mainly for fun. You can add your own files, and they are summoned via typing in their name.
.s (name...)

Note: files must be .mp3 or it will fail to find them.
